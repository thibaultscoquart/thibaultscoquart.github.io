About me
------

I am a french theoretical physicist, currently working as a postdoc in the Strongly Correlated Fermions group at LPT, Toulouse. My research interests cover a wide area of condensed matter physics, and many-body quantum dynamics in general. I have worked on disordered quantum systems and localization phenomena, for instance in ultracold atom setups during my Ph.D., and more recently on the analytical and numerical explorations of many-body localization transitions. I specialize in large-scale numerical methods related to such systems. I am also very interested in (digital) simulations of quantum dynamics on different implementations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and simulators, particularly the formulation of relevant many-body problems in terms of quantum circuits, and the manipulation and/or mitigation of experimental noise.
